        <h1>Welcome to the fuzz the bitmap file!</h2>
        <p>File format fuzzing is a testing method that identifies vulnerabilities by providing unexpected or malformed files to applications. This technique helps uncover bugs, such as crashes or security flaws, in software handling various file types.</p>

    <section>
        <p><strong>Bitmap fuzzing</strong> is a technique used to test software for vulnerabilities by generating and feeding random or malformed bitmap image files. This process helps reveal issues like crashes, buffer overflows, or memory leaks in applications that handle bitmap images, enhancing software robustness and security.</p>

            <p>The sample bitmap fuzzing done in this terminal</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1 : </strong>Type <u>ls</u> command in the terminal and click run button.
               The list of files will appear.
            <p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Type <u>pwd</u> command in the terminal and click run button.
               It will show the current directory.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>The sample bitmap file is stored in the name called sam.bmp and the fuzz target is in the file named fuzz_target.c
               These are the files needed for fuzzing.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Type <u>./fuzz_target public/inputs/sam.bmp</u> in the terminal and click run button.
               The libfuzzer will fuzz the bitmap file and give the output.</p>

        <h2>LibFuzzer</h2>
        <p>LibFuzzer is a powerful tool for fuzz testing, integrated with LLVM. It efficiently detects vulnerabilities in your bitmap processing code by generating random inputs and monitoring for crashes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
           It works by mutating inputs and monitoring the execution path to detect bugs and vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
           Targeted at C/C++ applications, especially those with functions that process user inputs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Integrates directly with LLVM-based projects and requires compilation with Clang.
        </li>
        <li>
            Efficient in detecting memory errors like buffer overflows.
        </li>
        <li>
           Supports integration with sanitizers like AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer for more accurate results.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)</h2>
        <p>AFL is a widely used fuzz testing tool that employs genetic algorithms to find bugs in applications. It automatically generates test cases based on the program's feedback.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            It is primarily used for fuzzing C/C++ applications but can be adapted for other languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            AFL requires instrumentation of the target program to track code coverage during execution.
        </li>
        <li>
            It generates random inputs and evolves them based on how much code they cover, improving fuzzing efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
            AFL helps find memory corruption bugs such as buffer overflows
        </li>
        </ul>
